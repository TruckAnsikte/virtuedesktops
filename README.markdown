VirtueDesktops
=============================================================================================================================

VirtueDesktops is a virtual desktop manager for Apple's Mac OS X "Tiger" operating system. It is based upon the work done by Rich Wareham on DesktopManager (specifically the CGSPrivate headers), which is an alternate open-source virtual desktop application. VirtueDesktops includes a small amount of Rich's code from DesktopManager, which means that presently it is licensed under the GPL.

Below are some of the key features of VirtueDesktops.

* **Virtual screens:** an unlimited number of virtual screens at your disposal
* **Eye candy:** exciting transitions and window fading
* **Universal binary:** runs at full speed on your shiny new intel-based mac
* **AppleScript-able:** script your desktop experience
* **Unobtrusive:** VirtueDesktops does not clutter your desktop - it gets in, switches your virtual screen and then quietly hides itself, waiting for your next request
* **Extensible:** install plugins to add additional features
* **Exposé:** works well with Apple's Exposé
* **Keeps you informed:** notifications and current desktop display orient you as you work across multiple virtual screens
* **"Stick-ify" your windows or applications:** Make your windows and applications visible across all of your virtual screens

**Sadly, VirtueDesktops is no longer under active development**. I'm making the source available here so that anyone who wishes to continue to the project can do so with a minimum of fuss. You're welcome to contact me for information about the implementation, or general source questions, but I no longer support the application itself.
