            If you do not want to actively switch Virtual Desktops but keep concentrating on the applications you work
            with, Virtue is able to automatically show the Virtual Desktop an application is currently displayed on. You 
            can thus use the Dock or the Command-Tab application switcher to navigate to the Virtual Desktop you need
            to be on.<p />
            To enable automatic desktop switching, 
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Open the preference window by selecting Virtue > Preferences</li>
                <li>Highlight the Application entry</li>
                <li>Check the <i>Change desktop to show focused application</i> option</li>
            </ul>

            The shown Virtual Desktop will now follow the focused application in all cases. If you want to restrict automatic
            switching to only happen in some cases, when you really want it, you can assign modifier keys that have to be 
            pressed at the time you activate an application. To set a modifier key, 
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Open the Application preferences by selecting Virtue > Preferences > Application</li>
                <li>Check one or multiple of the modifier options located below the <i>Change desktop to show focused 
                    application</i> option</li>
            </ul>
