            Virtual Desktops are distinct workspaces of which one is visible at a time. Each of these workspaces can show
            a different set of active applications, background pictures and icons. You can thus use Virtual Desktops to easily
            manage your applications by tasks and only have applications and documents you are actively working on shown 
            to you. <p />
            Virtual Desktops behave just like Mac OS X Desktops in that they can have their own Desktop Wallpaper and their
            own icon sets. Virtue provides folders for your Virtual Desktops inside the Virtual Desktop folder in your Home 
            Folder (alternatively in your Library/Application Support Folder).
