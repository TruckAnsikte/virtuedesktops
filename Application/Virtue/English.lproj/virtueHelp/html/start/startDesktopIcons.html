            Every Virtual Desktop can display its own icons. By assigning a unique icon set to a Virtual Desktop you can 
            make sure that you do not clutter your desktop with icons you will not need on a Virtual Desktop. <p />
            
            Virtual Desktops will always show the Icons and Folders you put into your default Desktop folder additionally
            to the Icons and Folders assigned to the Virtual Desktop itself. <p /> 
            
            To have a Virtual Desktop show its own icons,
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Open the Desktop Inspector and highlight the Virtual Desktop you want to customize</li>
                <li>Check Show Icon Set</li>
                <li>Open a Finder window and browse to the Virtual Desktop's folder</li>
                <li>Place the files and folders specific to the Virtual Desktop into the Virtual Desktop's folder</li>
            </ul>

            The Virtual Desktop will now show its own icons additionally to the Icons and Folders found in your Desktop
            folder if it is visible.
