            You can assign a unique wallpaper to each Virtual Desktop if you want to make sure you recognize the 
            visible Virtual Desktop at the first glance. Virtual Desktops will show the wallpaper you chose via the Mac 
            OS X System Preferences per default, see Mac OS X Help on how to assign the default wallpaper. <p />
            
            If you assigned a wallpaper to a Virtual Desktop, it will show its own instead of the default wallpaper. <p />
            
            To assign a wallpaper to a Virtual Desktop,
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>
                    Open a Finder window and browse to the Folder your wallpapers are located in. The Mac OS X default
                    wallpapers can be found under /Library/Desktop Pictures. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open the Desktop Inspector and highlight the Virtual Desktop you want to customize
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drag the wallpaper you want to assign to the Virtual Desktop from the Finder window to the desktop 
                    picture image view in the Desktop Inspector and Drop it there. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the Show Wallpaper checkbox to tell the Virtual Desktop to display its own wallpaper
                    intstead of the default one. 
                </li>
            </ul>
