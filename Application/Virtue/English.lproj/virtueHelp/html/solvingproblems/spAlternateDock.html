            If you are using an alternative to the Dock delivered with Mac OS 10.3, Virtue is still needing the original Dock
            to function properly, you of course can set it to hide automatically, so you will not see it. See Mac OS X Help on
            how to achive this. <p />
            For your day-to-day work you can of course display another Dock / Launcher like DragThing; to show it on all
            of your virtual desktops, follow these steps after starting Virtue: 
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Start your Dock / Launcher</li>
                <li>Open the Application Inspector by selecting Virtue Menu > Inspection > Applications...</li>
                <li>Highlight your Dock / Launcher application in the list of applications</li>
                <li>Check the <i>Show on all desktops</i> option</li>
            </ul>

            All of the alternate Docks windows will now appear on all of your Virtual desktops. Virtue will remember this 
            setting through restarts<br />
