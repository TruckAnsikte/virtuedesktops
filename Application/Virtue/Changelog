Virtue 0.5r3
Bugfix release.

		There is still a long way to go, as many features are still broken.

Virtue 0.5r2
Bugfix and Feature release. 

[NEW]	Reordering of desktops via the Pager (id1069967, id1081382, id1072262). 
[NEW]	Mouse triggers are now merged into the Trigger concept. You can assign
		mouse triggers to all actions you can assign hotkey triggers. 
[NEW]	Application sticky state remembered through restarts. 
[NEW]	Applications can be hidden from display in the Pager, useful for application
		you have stickied and know they are running.

[IMP]	Preferences were reorganized, I hope they are more easy to understand 
		now (thank you Nathan and Nicholas) (id1072246). 
[IMP]	PathFinder users not running the Finder should no longer get the Finder
		restarted by Virtue (id1071958); Virtue will also allow changing the 
		default wallpaper while running.
[FIX]	Applications on non-visible desktops should no longer pop up tooltips if
		they are listening to mouse events directly (e.g. Adium) (id1070430). 
[FIX]	Fixed preference saving. Preferences could be lost when shutting down 
		Virtue (id1069968, id1074781).
[FIX]	Transition animations can now be turned off (Kevin). 
[FIX]	Fixed a crash bug that was likely to crash Virtue upon desktop switches. 
[FIX]	Fixed position of Notification Bezel that was expecting the Dock to be 
		on the lower edge of the screen. 
[FIX]	Pager keyboard navigation is now complete. No need to touch the mouse
		(id1072265).
[FIX]	Fixed modifier names that were stated incorrectly in the user interface in 
		some places (id1078622).

[FIX]	Desktop navigation resulted in wrong desktops 
[FIX]	Overlay pager was reacting counter intuitive in most situations;
