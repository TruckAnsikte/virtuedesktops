# Thomas Staller	<playback (at) users (dot) sourceforge (dot) net> (Version 0.5r2 and below)

[Virtue 0.5r31/0.51b1]
[CHANGED] Everything is now building optimised, and headers are not being copied for non-framework targets 
[REMOVED] All debug logging
[FIXED] Reverted to older PNWindowList code which appears to not break mouse triggers. 

[Virtue 0.5r24]
[FIXED] Mouse triggers stop working after two uses
[REMOVED] Unused preference settings (eg. Show in dock)

[Virtue 0.5r17]
[REMOVED] Key equivalents from Virtue status menu. They can't be used whilst this is running with LSUIElement set to 1. 
[FIXED] Operations window will disable the individual window sticky settings when the application is sticky. It should in future also disable or hide the pop-up menus that control which desktop parents an application or window, as this seems to be interfering with the sticky bit. 
[NEW] Builds will automatically tag themselves with the latest full svn revision. 

[Virtue 0.5r14]
[CHANGED] Updated PNApplication to use PNWindowList rather than iterating over all the windows in the mWindows array.

[Virtue 0.5r12]
[FIXED] Replaced references to FSpGetInfo/FSpSetInfo with FSGetCatalogInfo/FSSetCatalogInfo. FSp*etInfo is deprecated under Tiger 
[FIXED] Reverted mac_inject to the official version (how did it ever change in the first place?!) 
[CHANGED] We now have some more optimisations enabled. Virtue seems to use a little less memory than it has been, but I'd say the memory usage isn't going to get much better while there are 3 frameworks, a static library and a bundle in the mix. Re-factoring (or at least simplification) will need to be put on the cards for 0.6 

[Virtue 0.5r10]
[FIXED] Virtue's automatic desktop switching on application change now works under Tiger.

[Virtue 0.5r3]
Bugfix release.
[CHANGED] Virtue is now only for Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" and later.
[FIXED]	Virtue now starts and (somewhat) works under Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger".
[NEW]	Added the Tiger-only transistion "Flip Desktop".

[Virtue 0.5r2]
Bugfix and Feature release. 

[NEW]	Reordering of desktops via the Pager (id1069967, id1081382, id1072262). 
[NEW]	Mouse triggers are now merged into the Trigger concept. You can assign mouse triggers to all actions you can assign hotkey triggers. 
[NEW]	Application sticky state remembered through restarts. 
[NEW]	Applications can be hidden from display in the Pager, useful for application you have stickied and know they are running. 
[NEW]	First version of user documentation (id1070872). 
[CHANGED]	Preferences were reorganized, I hope they are more easy to understand now (thank you Nathan and Nicholas) (id1072246). 
[CHANGED]	PathFinder users not running the Finder should no longer get the Finder restarted by Virtue (id1071958); Virtue will also allow changing the default wallpaper while running.
[FIXED]	Applications on non-visible desktops should no longer pop up tooltips ifthey are listening to mouse events directly (e.g. Adium) (id1070430). 
[FIXED]	Fixed preference saving. Preferences could be lost when shutting down Virtue (id1069968, id1074781).
[FIXED]	Transition animations can now be turned off (Kevin). 
[FIXED]	Fixed a crash bug that was likely to crash Virtue upon desktop switches. 
[FIXED]	Fixed position of Notification Bezel that was expecting the Dock to be on the lower edge of the screen. 
[FIXED]	Pager keyboard navigation is now complete. No need to touch the mouse(id1072265).
[FIXED]	Fixed modifier names that were stated incorrectly in the user interface in some places (id1078622).

[Virtue 0.4]
[NEW]	Application icons in notification window

		appearance. 
[NEW]	Operations menu window tinting and fading out of windows when 
		moving to a new desktop can now be turned off. 
[NEW]	Operations on all application windows. Applications can now be 
		stickied and sent to another desktop via the Operations menu. New
		windows for an application will inherit the sticky flag of their
		application (experimental). 
[FIXED]	Multi-screen setups should be fully supported now. Please report
		any problems you encounter. 
[FIXED]	Window alpha levels were overwritten upon sending to a 
		different desktop - they are now preserved. 
[FIXED]	Deleting of desktops did not work properly and Virtue 
		lost orientation - desktops can now be deleted 
[FIXED]	Deleting the last desktop is no longer allowed
[FIXED]	Deleting a desktop sent its windows to the wrong desktop
[FIXED]	Desktop switches that would result in the same desktop
		(e.g. in a one column layout switching to the left desktop)
		are now not carried out as designed. 
[FIXED]	Overlay pager did display deleted desktops
[FIXED]	Desktop navigation resulted in wrong desktops 
[FIXED]	Overlay pager was reacting counter intuitive in most situations;  
		the pager will now only switch to a desktop, if the mouse pointer 
		was under a desktop while closing, or if a desktop was clicked. 
[FIXED]	Fixed bug that prevented setting transition durations below 1 sec
