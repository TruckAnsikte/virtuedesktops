				<h1>Using the Desktop Pager</h1>
			</div>
				<p>A pager is an on-screen tool delivered with most virtual desktop managers that allows you to easily navigate between your desktops.</p>
				<p>Virtue&apos;s pager is only shown when you need to use it, and is designed for quick operation while still providing a good overview of available desktops. The pager can be operated in two distinct modes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Normal Mode</strong><br />In normal mode, the pager will display only as while the Trigger Modifiers used to bring it up are pressed.</li>
	<li><strong>Sticky Mode</strong><br />In sticky mode, the pager will stay on the screen as long as it has focus and you don't select another desktop. Once the pager loses focus (e.g. another window is activated), it will close.</li>
</ul>
				<!-- Try to keep this text short on a task page. -->

				<div summary="How to use the pager to navigate your desktops" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To navigate your desktops using the pager:</strong>
						<p>You can highlight desktops via the keyboard, or via the mouse. 
							<ol><li>First, bring the pager up - we'll do this using the stick mode for this example by pressing Shift + Tab (this can be customised later).</li>
								 <li>If you're using your mouse to select desktops simply hover over the desktop you wish to switch to. If you're using your keyboard, use the arrow keys.</li>
								<li>To switch to the currently selected desktop, you can either click your mouse or press either the Enter or Space key.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>You can also dismiss the pager by either clicking outside the pager window, or by pressing the Escape key.</p>
