                    The buit-in pager was enhanced to allow more keyboard navigation. Use the arrow keys to 
                    navigate, return and space to select and the escape key to abort. On popup the shown desktop

                    Virtue is now no longer depending on a running Finder, but is also working with alternatives like
                    Path Finder, and wll not insist on restarting the Finder. If you don't like it, Virtue is not forcing you.

                    You are now no longer dependant on the keyboard to reach various functions Virtue provides. Triggers
                    allow you to bind actions to either hotkeys or edges of the screen. Open the pager via the mouse by 
                    throwing the mouse pointer to the left edge of the screen and click twice there for example. Its fun, try it.
