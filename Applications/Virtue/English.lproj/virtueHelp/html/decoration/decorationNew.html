            Decoration Primitives are managed by the Desktop Inspector. To add a new decoration primitive, 
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Open the Desktop Inspector and highlight the desktop you want to decorate</li>
                <li>Push the <i>Add primitive</i> button located below the list of primitives</li>
                <li>Select the type of primitive to add in the opened menu</li>
            </ul>
            
            The primitive is now added to the decoration and can be configured by opening the Primitive 
            Inspector Panel by pressing the <i>Info</i> button. <p />
            Decorations display their primitives from the top of the list to the bottom, you can reorder 
            them by dragging primitives around.
