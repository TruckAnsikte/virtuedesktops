            Recognizing which Virtual Desktop is currently shown is sometimes hard, more so if you want to recognize
            it at the first glance. One way of making desktops unique is to assign a separate wallpaper for each desktop,
            but you will run out of cool wallpapers soon (at laest I did). <p />
            Virtue can put other non-intrusive visual hints on your Virtual Desktops to help you recognize the desktop
            fast and without effort. <p />
            Each desktop can be decorated using one or more Decoration Primitives that are displayed in a specific order
            and can be configured in appearance and content to your likening. Desktop Decorations are managed by 
            the Desktop Inspector for each Desktop separately.
