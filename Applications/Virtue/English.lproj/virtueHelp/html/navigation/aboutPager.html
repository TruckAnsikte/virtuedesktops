            A pager is a tool delivered with most Virtual Desktop managers that allows you to select one of your Virtual Desktops
            by laying them out to chose. <p />
            Virtues pager shows on demand and is designed for quick operation while still providing a good overview of available 
            desktops. The pager can be operated in two distinct modes: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sticky Mode<br />
                    In sticky mode, the pager will display and stick on the screen as long as it has focus and no
                    desktop was selected. Once it looses focus (another window was activated e.g.), it will close.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Normal Mode<br />
                    In normal mode, the pager will display as long as the Trigger Modifiers used to bring it up 
                    are pressed. 
                </li>
            </ul>
