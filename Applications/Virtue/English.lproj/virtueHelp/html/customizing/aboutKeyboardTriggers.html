            You can use Keyboard Triggers to bind an Action to a specific key-combination. <p />
            
            Key combinations used in Keyboard Triggers consist of the Modifiers and the Key parts. Modifiers are 
            special keys on your keyboard like Shift, Alternate and the Command key. The Key part is virually any 
            other key you can find on your keyboard. <p />
            
            When pressed in combination, Virtue will execute the Action no matter which application has the focus
            at the time you use the Keyboard Trigger. <p />
            
            You can for example bind the Action "Show desktop to the west" to the Keyboard Trigger Alternate-Command-Left Arrow
            and Virtue will switch to the desktop to the left whenever you press this key-combination.
