            Triggers allow you to bind Actions you want to access frequently to a convinient shortcut so you can reach them 
            easily and be efficient. <p />
            
            Virtue provides a wide range of Actions that can be bound to either Keyboard shortcuts or Mouse shortcuts called 
            Keyboard Triggers and Mouse Triggers. An Action provided by Virtue can have multiple Triggers associated with it,
            but a Trigger can only be assigned to one Action at a time.<p />
            
            Triggers can be added and removed from within Virtues preferences. To open the Triggers Preferences, 
            
            <ul id="taskbox">
                <li>Select Virtue > Preferences...</li>
                <li>Highlight the Triggers entry in the list of preference panes</li>
            </ul>
