            You can use Mouse Triggers to bind an Action to the edges of your screen.<p />

            Virtue currently supports binding Actions to the four edges of your screen. Just like Keyboard Triggers, Mouse Triggers
            consist of the Edge part and a Modifiers part. The Edge part specifies the screen edge you want to bind the Action to, the
            Modifiers part includes 
            
            <ul>
                <li>Delay in seconds you have to rest your mouse pointer at the edge until the action is triggered</li>
                <li>Click Count specifying how many times you have to click in the edge so the action is triggered</li>
                <li>Modifier Key specifying which modifier keys have to be pressed so the action is triggered</li>
            </ul>
            
            Modifiers can be combined to give you a lot of different Mouse Triggers to choose from. Note that the Delay modifier
            is only considered if the Click Count is set to 0. <p />
            
            You can bind the Action "Show desktop to the west" to the Mouse Trigger "Left Edge" with a delay of 1 second to show the
            desktop to the left if you throw your mouse pointer into the left edge and stay there for a second. <p />
            
            You can bind the Action "Show Pager" to the Mouse Trigger "Left Edge" with a Click Count of 1 to show the pager if you 
            throw your mouse pointer into the left edge and click there once.
